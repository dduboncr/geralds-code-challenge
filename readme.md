### How to run unit test

### Technical Decision

- Added Node.js/Express for a simple API endpoint, Typescript to add type validations and strong type check
- Decided to create a class that can handle all type of calculations of scores and that can be extensible on the future.
- Decided to unit test with Jest just because is easy and simple to use.
